# 🧠 Graph4ASD Challenge 

**[Live Leaderboard](https://rosepy.github.io/Graph4ASD-Challenge)**

## 📌 Overview

This repository hosts the **Graph4ASD Challenge**, a graph machine learning competition focused on **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classification** using **resting-state fMRI functional connectivity data** from the **ABIDE dataset**.

Participants must design and train **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** models to classify subjects as:

- ASD  
- Typical Control (TC)  

based on **brain connectivity graphs**.

Each subject is represented as a graph where:

- Nodes → brain regions (Craddock 200 atlas)  
- Edges → functional connectivity between brain regions  

---

## 🏆 Leaderboard

Leaderboard scores are automatically updated.

## 🧠 Task Description

Each sample corresponds to **one subject’s brain graph**.

### Graph Definition

\[
G = (A, X)
\]

Where:

- **A** → adjacency matrix (functional connectivity)  
- **X** → node feature matrix (identity features)
- **Nodes** → 200 brain regions (Craddock atlas)  

### Objective

Train a model that correctly predicts whether a subject:

- has **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**  
- or is a **Typical Control (TC)**  

using:

- Graph structure  
- Node features  

This is a **graph-level classification task**.

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset is derived from:

> **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)**

ABIDE aggregates anonymized rs-fMRI data from **17 international sites**.

### Full Dataset (original ABIDE)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Subjects | 1,009 |
| ASD | 516 (51.14%) |
| Controls | 493 (48.86%) |
| Brain atlas | Craddock 200 |

⚠️ For the challenge, a **processed subset** is provided, 484 samples for train and 153 for test. Participants must use data as-is, since original data has been exclusively processed for this challenge. 

---

## 🧩 Data Representation

Each subject is stored as a graph:

- **Adjacency matrix (A)** → connectivity between brain regions  
- **Feature matrix (X)** → node-level features  

All graphs share:

- Same number of nodes → **200**  
- Same node ordering → Craddock atlas

## 📂 Dataset Access

The dataset is hosted in folder `data/public`. 



## 📝 How to Submit Your Results

### Step 1: Train
Train your model using:
- Graphs: Adjacency matrix and node feature matrix in `data/public/adj_train.npy` and `data/public/node_features.npy`. Each 
- labels in `data/public/train_label.csv`

### Step 2: Predict
Predict labels for every graph in:
- `data/public/adj_test.npy` and `data/public/node_features_test.npy`

### Step 3: Prepare your submission file
Create a CSV with columns `filename` and `prediction` (same format as `submissions/sample_submission.csv`):

```csv
id,label
1,0
2,0
3,1
...
```
Save it as a `.csv` file (e.g. `my_submission.csv`) in the **`submissions/`** folder.  
**Note:** ❗ Do NOT upload the raw CSV. You need to submit an **encrypted** version of your predictions file to keep privacy.

### Step 4: Encrypt your submission
From the project root, run the encryption script so it can find your CSV and the encryption key:

```bash
cd submissions
python ../encryption/encrypt_submissions.py <filename>
cd ..
```

This creates a `.enc` file next to each `.csv` in `submissions/` (e.g. `my_submission.csv.enc`). Only `.enc` files are tracked by git; your `.csv` stays local.

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request
Commit and push the new `.enc` file(s) to the repository (e.g. open a Pull Request or push to the main branch, as per the challenge rules). The automated pipeline will decrypt and score your submission to update the leaderboard.

⚠️ Only **one submission per participant** is allowed.

## 🏁 Challenge Rules

- You are free to use any Graph Neural Network.
- You are not allowed to use external data.
- You must not try to identify each subject.
